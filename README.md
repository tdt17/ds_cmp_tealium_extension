# ds_tealium_extension

Repository for Javascript Tealium extensions

## About The Project

The goal of this project is to generalize Tealium extensions for the usage on different profiles and to centralize
development.

The project is hosted on GitHub. Changes will automatically be synced by Tealium.

## Extensions

### CMP Interaction Tracking Extension

Extension for triggering Adobe Analytics tracking events of the consent layer application (cmp).

In order to make the extension work in all Tealium profiles, the Adobe TagId of each profile needs to be determined.
This is done by a static mapping of the profile's name to a certain TagId. Be careful to update the mapping table inside
the extension, in case profiles or Adobe tags are changing.


### Adobe DoPlugins Extension

This extension is the result of a refactoring and generalization process of the various existing DoPlugins extensions.
The goal of the refactoring was to have only one centralized version of this extension which can be used on all brand 
profiles. [Read more](https://github.com/spring-media/ds_cmp_tealium_extension/blob/master/extensions/doPlugins_global.README.md)

The extension contains features which are needed for the Adobe Analytics tracking.

The different features are organized as simple Javascript objects which are attached to the global S-Object which 
is provided by the Adobe Analytics tag.

### Adobe DoPlugins App Extensions (Bild and Welt)

In addition to the global doPlugins extension there are three app extensions (doPlugins_bild_apps, doPlugins_welt_apps_android, doPlugins_welt_apps_ios) which are the generalized and refactored version for different Bild and Welt apps. The app extensions specifically cater for tracking on the mobile platforms.

Good luck!
